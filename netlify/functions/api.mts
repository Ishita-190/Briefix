A **felony** is a more serious crime that can result in imprisonment for more than one year, and in some cases, life imprisonment or even the death penalty. Examples include murder, rape, robbery, and drug trafficking.

The main differences are:
- **Severity**: Felonies are more serious than misdemeanors
- **Punishment**: Felonies carry longer prison sentences
- **Rights**: Felony convictions can result in loss of voting rights and gun ownership
- **Employment**: Felony convictions can make it harder to find employment`,

**Here's what I can tell you:**
Legal matters can be complex and the specific answer depends on your unique situation, location, and circumstances. What might be true in one case may not apply to another.

- This may involve multiple areas of law
